# Zairza Demo Repo for Hacktoberfest

This is a README, which is essentially a markdown file where various details related to the repository, tool or project are mentioned. 

There are various formatting techniques used to format texts in different ways in a markdown file with a `.md` extension.

## Formatting in Markdown Files

Mostly the formatting is implemented by wrapping the text in certain characters or adding them to the beginning of the text.

### Highlighting Texts 

- For making a text **Bold** wrap the text within `** **`.
- For making a text *Italic* wrap the text within `* *`.
- For striking out ~some text~ wrap it between `~ ~`.
(We also created a list here by preceding the list items with a hyphen `-`.) 

### Quoting a Text

you can quote a line of text by adding `>` at the beginning of the line.

and you can quote some lines of code by adding ``` before and after the code.

```
some code 
is written here

```
For highlighting keywords, variables and other words in the code, one can use specific formatting for the language in which the code is written.

```js

This code is written in Javascript(){
    hence the keywords are highlighted differently.
}

```
More about Markdown syntax can be [found here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) 

P.S- That's how you add a link in the file embedded within a user-defined text.
